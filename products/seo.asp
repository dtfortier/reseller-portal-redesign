To deliver this optimization at an affordable price point, maximize customer placement, and maximize customer return, we ensure that the key phrase selection process is as focused as possible. This allows the SEO team to focus fulfillment on these key phrases within the scope of the planned SEO tasks throughout the term of the agreement.</p>
								  <p>While we could allow for optimization of single keywords, in many cases the intense competition for some keywords would require optimization efforts that are outside the scope of the standard SEO3/6/9 product. If a customer is looking for a much more managed approach to SEO you could certainly review some custom optimization packaging and pricing with the client.</p>

                                  At times, we see the SEO URL being overshadowed by the Landing Page URL in organic searches. Though higher ranking for the Landing Page URL is not the norm, it can result from a variety of standard optimizations that we apply to both the Landing Page as found through Local Search as well as the SEO URL. Each link has different strengths in terms of search engine optimization and maintaining both helps to increase the customer's exposure. The search engine algorithms have sole control over the URL that is used in display the customer's Landing Page. While the salesperson or customer may view the SEO URL as the primary product of the SEO campaign, it is simply one part. While the SEO URL can be an important piece of the optimization, the focus of SEO is to optimize and drive traffic to the customer's Landing Page regardless of the URL displayed in the organic results.

								Broadly, rankings are determined by the search engines algorithms based on your perceived authority on the phrases/subjects you present throughout your online presence. If you notice some keywords are ranking better than others, it's an indication that the lagging keywords have more competition or need more time and content to build that authority.

								Keywords are never really "poor" so long as they relate to a business and its services. However, if after several months of SEO, you are not seeing any progress towards the front page, the keywords may need to be refined as they are either too broad or too competitive. This is generally resolved by making them longer-tail keywords, which includes making them more descriptive.

								<p>We are constantly monitoring rankings for both Advanced and Custom SEO products, so if keywords begin to head in the direction we don't want, we know, and we are reacting. Whether that means we are currently looking into why this occured, formulating a plan to return us to our previous rankings, or already implementing a solution, we are on it.</p>
								<p>If keywords have just recently dropped, this may simply be a keyword fluctuation, which can happen with every crawl of any website that is attempting (or coincidentally) ranking for that keyword. If something has changed to make another site more of an authority than your site or another competitor's site, then that site may move up and bump everyone back. Alternatively, sometimes search engines like to test different results within the first page. This is an attempt to give sites which would not normally be on the first page a change to rank in order to gauge use experience. If they score well, they may receive permanent increase in rankings.</p>

								<p>You don't necessarily ever want to change keywords, unless the business no longer offers those products/services. If keywords are having a difficult time ranking or are not bringing in estimated traffic numbers, they may be a good candidate for refinement. If all the keywords are ranking, then you may wish to add more keywords focused on more defined phrases, additional services/products, or even larger geo areas. This can be done by utilizing a larger SEOC package.</p>
								<p>If a ranking keyword is selected to be removed from the campaign, then the performance of that phrase may drop due to competitive efforts. A keyword set should always include the most prominent products/services and those should not be on a rotating list, since keywords need time to rank.</p>

								<li>LSI Keywords:  Continued optimization for phrases will naturally lead to ranking for synonymous phrases, which increases a site's change at traffic and conversions.</li>

                                  <p>Three or four years ago seeking out backlinks was a usual practice employed by SEO strategists. Today, however, the only truly white-hat way to earn those backlinks is via well-written, relevant content on the site. You want visitors to see these additions and post links on their social media pages, blogs, or possible their own site, where their visitors may end up clicking it and landing on yours.</p>
									<p>Seeking out backlinks via blog swapping, trading, or planting is actually considered black-hat and if caught doing so it may result in a manual action (penalty) from the search engines, causing the website to struggle to rank or become deindexed altogether.</p>

                                  <p>This happens sometimes, as not everyone has the same style or preference when it comes to content. Business owners, of course, are entitled to say "I do not want this on my site as a representation of my business."</p>
								  <p>However, if the strategist implements any form of content (lists, text, images, infographics, reviews/testimonials, videos, DIYs, blogs, etc.) it is because they believe it is for the benefit of the campaign. If these are removed it will harm the campaign--either by losing rankings or by preventing ranking improvement. It is best that the customers know that everything we do is to benefit their online presence, so that they can consider this when removing/editing any work we've done.</p>

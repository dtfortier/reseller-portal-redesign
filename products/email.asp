                                  This is often due to the SPAM controls utilized by the the customer's email recipients. Your customer can mention to his/her clients to be sure to check their Spam/Junk email folder for the Constant Contact-generated emails. Typically the user can then right click the email and choose to add the sender to their Safe Senders list so that future emails are not considered SPAM.

                                  This is a compliance issue. At times a flag will trigger at Constant Contact for various reasons such as a large upload of contacts or a large number of bounce backs from an email. Our agreement with Constant Contact calls out that the customer needs to work directly with Constant Contact for any compliance issues and/or account reviews. Constant Contact will speak with the customer to determine how they generated their contacts. The goal of the compliance review is to optimize delivery dates and oversee their anti-SPAM policy. The customer will need to know the username/email address associated with their Constant Contact account when they call.

                                  Yes, these can be created directly within the customer's Constant Contact account. The customer utilizes a "Customize My Form" wizard in the Constant Contact console to customize the widget/link. The wizard then provides HTML code for the customized widget/link and this code can be added to their Website, Landing Page, etc. The QR code set up works in a similar way, however instead of code, the customer will be provided with a .jpg file of their QR code to add to their marketing literature. By clicking "Learn More" beneath each type of Sign Up Tool, you and the customer can see how easy each item is to generate and work with. Customer Experience can also assist customers with the creation of each of these.

If a customer requires their backend credentials, please contact Customer Experience who can work with our developers to provide this information. Please be sure to remind customers to always access their Constant Contact account via the Customer Dashboard, and not directly through the Constant Contact website, in order to avoid locking their account. The backend credentials should be used only when needed to install a widget.

                                  <p>Yes. A very important detail to remember, especially when customers use Grow My List features, is that they must be careful to ensure the total number of contacts in their account does not surpass the product level they have purchased from LocalEdge. For example, a customer with CC500 needs to be sure they do not exceed 500 contacts at any given time, or else they will be charged for a higher product level depending on the number of contacts they have. If a CC500 account with one contact adds 5000 contacts, for even a moment, then deletes those 5000 contacts, the customer will be liable for the cost of a CC10K account for that month.</p>
								  <p>Product levels are as follows:</p>
								  <p>
								  <ul>
								  <li>CC500 (0-500 contacts)</li>
								  <li>CC2K (501-2500 contacts)</li>
								  <li>CC5K (2501-5000 contacts)</li>
								  <li>CC10K (5001 10000 contacts)</li>
								  <li>CC25K (10001-25000 contacts)</li>

                                  <p>Do:</p>
								  <ul>
								  <li>Obtain clear and conspicuous consent for all uploaded contacts. Your notice should allow users to easily and readily understand exactly what they are consenting to prior to providing their email address.</li>
								  <li>Set proper expectations surrounding messaging content and frequency. Stick to it and don't deviate. Become a trusted mailer.</li>
								  <li>Spend the time to keep your list current. We recomment 12-24 months in most circumstances. Many industry reports state that an average list churns approximately 30% each year. Manage bounces and remove non-existent addresses.</li>
								  <li>Honor your 'opt-outs' from previous email service providers or mailing systems.</li>
								  <li>Segment your contact lists and target your subscribers. Also, collect the opt-in date of each contact. Segmenting by this date will help if your list begins to garner complaints.</li>
								  <li>Use social media as a way to add interested contacts and grow your list.</li>
								  <li>Use recognizable "From:" and "Subject:" lines and keep those consistent. Contacts need to immediately recognize who the message is from and what it's about.</li>
								  <li>Keep images in proportion to your text</li>
								  <li>Use Constant Contact's tools to get a better understanding of your contact list(s).</li>
								  <li>Take the time to read Constant Contact's Terms of Service and review their Prohibited Content policy.</li>
								  </ul>
                                  <br/>
								  <p>Don't:</p>
								  
								  <ul>
								  <li>Use 3rd party, purchased, web-scraped, or appended contact lists or add any contact that has not given their consent to receive future marketing communications from you. Implied permission often results in elevated SPAM complaints.</li>
								  <li>Over-message and/or try and be tricky by changing the content of your message.</li>
								  <li>Assume email addresses live forever. Also be sure to frequently sync your Constant Contact lists with any internal database you may run.</li>
								  <li>Import contacts have have opted-out, or have previously complained that your email was SPAM, thinking that a new email marketing platform will change their minds.</li>
								  <li>Just collect and add email addresses and expect marketing success. Marketing takes work and the more useful information you have the better off you'll be in segmenting your lists.</li>
								  <li>Assume because someone "Friends" or "Follows" you that they are interested in receiving future marketing emails from you. Apply the same level of consent described above.</li>
								  <li>Send overly flashy, misleading, or long subject lines as SPAM filters will key in on them.</li>
								  <li>Send emails with flashy fonts and colors, that are excessively long, or contain a single .jpg.</li>
								  <li>Try to clean or wash your list through Constant Contact. Their reputation relies on a clean mailstream and list washing is not tolerated.</li>

                                  Occasionally a customer will try to use their Customer Dashboard login credentials to access their Constant Contact account directly. Unfortunately, the Customer Dashboard credentials will not allow them to login. After three unsuccessful attempts the account will become locked. At this time, please contact Customer Experience who will issue a support ticket asking Constant Contact to unlock the account and reset the password. Please remind the customer to always use the Customer Dashboard to access their Constant Contact account. Unlocking the account typically takes 24 hours.

                                  <p>Constant Contact's Image Library allows for up to five images to be stored. Once one or more of these images is deleted from the Constant Contact media library the image(s) will also be deleted from the customer's emails. Our solution for this issue is to point customers to our Customer Dashboard Media Library where they can store a very large number of images and files which can be used on any of their LocalEdge products as opposed to just Constant Contact. Customers use the image URL from the Customer Dashboard Media Library.</p>
								  <p>To add images to the Customer Dashboard Media Library, then add them to a Constant Contact email please use the following steps:</p>
								  <p>First, the image(s) must be added to the Media Library. Once added to the Media Library, the image(s) can be added to a Constant Contact email. The following steps describe how:</p>
								  <p><span>Add the Image(s) to the Media Library</span></p>
								  <p>
								  <ol>
								  <li>Login to the Customer Dashboard</li>
								  <li>Right click on My Media (opening the Media Library in a separate tab will allow for easy acess to the files while you are in another program such as the Constant Contact console) and click Open Link In New Tab</li>
								  <li>Upload the image(s) by clicking the "Add Media" button in the Media Library</li>
								  <li>Browse for up to five image files at a time in the Add Media screen. A filename is required for each image. An optional description may also be added. Be sure to click "Save" at the bottom of the page to successfully upload the file(s). You will then be redirected back to the Media Library where your image file(s) will be listed. Keep the Media Library tab open in order to return easily to the Media Library while you create your Constant Contact email.</li>
								  </ol>
								  </p>
								  <p><span>Add the Image(s) to a Constant Contact Email</span></p>
								  <p>
								  <ol>
								  <li>Navigate back to the Customer Dashboard</li>
								  <li>Under Email Marketing, click on Manage to open the Constant Contact console</li>
								  <li>Click "Email" to be redirected to the My Emails page</li>
								  <li>Select the existing draft email you wish to add an image to, or click "Create" to generate a new email. If a new email is selected be sure to select the template you want associated with the email</li>
								  <li>Hover your mouse pointer over the email block you wish to add the image(s) to and click the pencil icon to edit the email block</li>
								  <li>To add an image to the block, place your cursor in the block and select "Image" from the list of available elements along the left side of the screen. The Insert Image window will open.</br>
								  To change an existing image, right click on the image and select "Change." The Insert Image window will open.</li>
								  <li>Click "Image URL" in the Insert Image window</li>
								  <li>Go back to the Media Library and click "View" under Actions for the image you wish to add. This will open the image in a new tab or window</li>
								  <li>Copy the URL of the image and go back to the Constant Contact console</li>
								  <li>Pages the image URL into the "Use an Image URL" field, then click "Preview." Add clickable text, caption, and image description if desired. Also change the alignment and image dimensions if needed</li>
								  <li>Click "Insert" to add or update the existing image. You will now be redirected back to the email</li>
								  <li>Make any final modifications to the text or image(s) in the email block, then click "Save."</li>

The coordinators need to be notified of the changes in a timely manner (two weeks prior to send date is preferable), and final approval needs to be given to the coordinator every time before the new designs can be broadcasted.
